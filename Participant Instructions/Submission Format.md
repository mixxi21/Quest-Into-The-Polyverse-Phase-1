Welcome to the Polyverse submission guide. Follow these detailed steps to ensure your project meets all the submission requirements and is ready for evaluation.

## **Step-by-Step Submission Instructions**

### **Step 1: Finalize Your Project**

Ensure your project is complete, including all coding, testing, and final touches. Remember, a polished project makes a strong impression.

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Project Repository**

- Create a new GitHub repository for your project or ensure your existing project repository is organized and up-to-date.
- Include all source code, assets, data files, and any other materials required to run your project.

### **Step 3: Craft a Comprehensive README**

Your **`README.md`** file is the first thing evaluators will see, so make it count. It should include:

- **Project Title:** A clear and concise title for your project.
- **Team Members:** List of team members and their roles/contributions.
- **Project Overview:** A brief description of your project, including the problem it solves.
- **Run-book:** Step-by-step guide to test your project, including any dependencies.
- (**Resources Used:** List of frameworks, libraries, and tools used in your project.)
- **Challenges Faced:** Briefly discuss any significant challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
- **What We Learned:** Highlight key learnings your team took away from this project.
- **Future Improvements:** Share any plans for future enhancements or iterations of your project.
- **License:** Specify the license under which your project is released.

### **Step 4: Proof of Testnet Interactions (Must)**

It is mandatory for projects to include documented proof of interactions with a testnet, such as:

- Transaction hashes.
- Smart contract addresses of your contract (or Port addresses)
- Screenshots or videos of the transactions.

### **Step 5: Include a Demo Video (Recommended)**

While not mandatory, a demo video can significantly enhance your submission by showcasing your project's functionality and features. Keep it concise (3-5 minutes) and focused on what makes your project stand out.

### **Step 6: Submit Your Project**

- Ensure your project repository is public and accessible.

## **Additional Tips for a Successful Submission**

- **Double-Check:** Before submitting, review your repository to ensure everything is in place and functioning as expected.
- **Engage with the Community:** Share your project with fellow participants and gather feedback to make last-minute improvements.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep an eye on Polyverse announcements for any last-minute changes or updates to the submission process.

Note: Projects that can successfully onboard a broader community to try out their application will be prioritized in the evaluation process.
